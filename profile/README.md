###### Totally not me experimenting with hard-forking SR to prove a point.

This is a semi-closed organisation explicitly for testing forking of SR and keeping up to date with critical fixes on my lonesome self. Contributions are welcome, but ultimately unnecessary.

I might also use this as a testbed for various invasive overhauls that I might want to do without dealing with SR modularity.

Who knows, maybe a server will come out of this if I find enough folk.
